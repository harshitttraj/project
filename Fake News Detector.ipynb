      "['no comment is expected from barack obama members of the #fyf911 or #fukyoflag and #blacklivesmatter movements called for the lynching and hanging of white people and cops. they encouraged others on a radio show tuesday night to  turn the tide  and kill white people and cops to send a message about the killing of black people in america.one of the f***yoflag organizers is called  sunshine.  she has a radio blog show hosted from texas called,  sunshine s f***ing opinion radio show. a snapshot of her #fyf911 @lolatwhitefear twitter page at 9:53 p.m. shows that she was urging supporters to  call now!! #fyf911 tonight we continue to dismantle the illusion of white below is a snapshot twitter radio call invite   #fyf911the radio show aired at 10:00 p.m. eastern standard time.during the show, callers clearly call for  lynching  and  killing  of white people.a 2:39 minute clip from the radio show can be heard here. it was provided to breitbart texas by someone who would like to be referred to as  hannibal.  he has already received death threats as a result of interrupting #fyf911 conference calls.an unidentified black man said  when those mother f**kers are by themselves, that s when when we should start f***ing them up. like they do us, when a bunch of them ni**ers takin  one of us out, that s how we should roll up.  he said,  cause we already roll up in gangs anyway. there should be six or seven black mother f**ckers, see that white person, and then lynch their ass. let s turn the tables. they conspired that if  cops started losing people,  then  there will be a state of emergency. he speculated that one of two things would happen,  a big-ass [r s?????] war,  or  ni**ers, they are going to start backin  up. we are already getting killed out here so what the f**k we got to lose? sunshine could be heard saying,  yep, that s true. that s so f**king true. he said,  we need to turn the tables on them. our kids are getting shot out here. somebody needs to become a sacrifice on their side.he said,  everybody ain t down for that s**t, or whatever, but like i say, everybody has a different position of war.  he continued,  because they don t give a f**k anyway.  he said again,  we might as well utilized them for that s**t and turn the tables on these n**ers. he said, that way  we can start lookin  like we ain t havin  that many casualties, and there can be more causalities on their side instead of ours. they are out their killing black people, black lives don t matter, that s what those mother f**kers   so we got to make it matter to them. find a mother f**ker that is alone. snap his ass, and then f***in hang him from a damn tree. take a picture of it and then send it to the mother f**kers. we  just need one example,  and  then people will start watchin .  this will turn the tables on s**t, he said. he said this will start  a trickle-down effect.  he said that when one white person is hung and then they are just  flat-hanging,  that will start the  trickle-down effect.  he continued,  black people are good at starting trends. he said that was how  to get the upper-hand. another black man spoke up saying they needed to kill  cops that are killing us. the first black male said,  that will be the best method right there. breitbart texas previously reported how sunshine was upset when  racist white people  infiltrated and disrupted one of her conference calls. she subsequently released the phone number of one of the infiltrators. the veteran immediately started receiving threatening calls.one of the #f***yoflag movement supporters allegedly told a veteran who infiltrated their publicly posted conference call,  we are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife, and your f***ing piece of sh*t unborn creature will be hung from a tree. breitbart texas previously encountered sunshine at a sandra bland protest at the waller county jail in texas, where she said all white people should be killed. she told journalists and photographers,  you see this nappy-ass hair on my head?   that means i am one of those more militant negroes.  she said she was at the protest because  these redneck mother-f**kers murdered sandra bland because she had nappy hair like me. #fyf911 black radicals say they will be holding the  imperial powers  that are actually responsible for the terrorist attacks on september 11th accountable on that day, as reported by breitbart texas. there are several websites and twitter handles for the movement. palmetto star  describes himself as one of the head organizers. he said in a youtube video that supporters will be burning their symbols of  the illusion of their superiority,  their  false white supremacy,  like the american flag, the british flag, police uniforms, and ku klux klan hoods.sierra mcgrone or  nocturnus libertus  posted,  you too can help a young afrikan clean their a** with the rag of oppression.  she posted two photos, one that appears to be herself, and a photo of a black man, wiping their naked butts with the american flag.for entire story: breitbart news law enforcement on high alert following threats against cops and whites on 9-11by #blacklivesmatter and #fyf911 terrorists [video]'\n",

      " 'mexico city (reuters) - donald trump’s combative style has buffeted mexico’s president for months, but deeply unpopular enrique pena nieto may end up thanking the new u.s. president for prompting offended mexicans to rally behind their leader.  from billionaire business magnate carlos slim to political opponents, there has been a groundswell of support for pena nieto, who has cut a lonely figure in months of bruising encounters with trump. often referred to by his initials epn, pena nieto is laboring under the worst approval ratings of any mexican president in decades due to discontent over corruption, gang violence, sluggish growth and a jump in fuel prices.     trump’s threats to scrap the nafta trade deal with mexico and build a border wall have caused anger and left mexicans feeling fearful for the future. his challenge to pena nieto on thursday - saying he should skip a planned summit between the two leaders if mexico wasn’t willing to pay for the wall - was the final straw. pena nieto replied a couple of hours later that he had canceled his meeting with trump, one of the president’s biggest ever hits on twitter, getting more “likes” than when he personally broke news of the capture of notorious drug lord joaquin “el chapo” guzman in january of last year. “bravo epn!,” cheered former president vicente fox, who had initially condemned pena nieto for inviting trump to mexico for talks last august, and who has waged a colorful and expletive-ridden campaign against the republican on twitter. pena nieto and trump talked for about an hour by phone on friday, pledging to work out their differences and agreeing not to speak about the wall in public for now. meanwhile, calls for unity grew in mexico, led by slim, a normally media-shy 76-year-old who gave a 90-minute news conference in support of the government on friday. “this is the most surprising example of national unity i’ve seen in my life,” said slim, who spent several years in the past decade as the world’s richest man. “we have to back the president of mexico so he can defend our national interests.” senior opposition leaders also urged a common front. “it’s time to show unity and our commitment to mexico,” alejandra barrales, head of the center-left party of the democratic revolution (prd), said on twitter. pena nieto’s credibility has been battered by a widespread public perception that he has failed to battle corruption and indeed even encouraged it since a conflict-of-interest row embroiled him, his wife and a top minister in late 2014. some opposition critics fear the government will try to use trump as a screen to distract from its failings. however, two senior officials told reuters they hoped pena nieto would seize the moment to act quickly and decisively to improve his image. expressions of dismay at trump’s behavior towards mexico have almost become a national pastime, and talk of boycotts against u.s. companies is gathering steam on social media. slim, when asked about boycotting at his news conference, said it wasn’t a good idea to turn on u.s. companies, which are creating jobs in mexico. some foreign companies voiced support for mexico too. “i feel mexico is being subjected to terror at the moment,” said andreas schindler, co-owner of german fruit wholesaler don limon’s parent pilz schindler, by phone from hamburg. “we’re right behind mexico.”  trump tussle gives unpopular mexican leader much-needed shot in arm'\n",
